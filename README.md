what I learn when spent 100 credits in 3 days with loveable.dev



**1. Use Gemini/ChatGPT to organize your thoughts, then feed the well-designed Product Requirements Document (PRD) to Loveable.**

*   **Why this is a good strategy:**
    *   **Clarification and Structuring of Requirements:** Gemini and ChatGPT excel at processing natural language and can organize scattered ideas and requirements into a clear, logically structured PRD. This helps eliminate ambiguity and ensures the information fed to Loveable.dev is explicit and complete.
    *   **Reduce Loveable's Comprehension Load (and potential Credit Consumption):** While Loveable.dev is powerful, giving it very vague or broad requirements might lead to more rounds of interaction (consuming more credits) to clarify, or the generated code might not fully meet expectations. A clear PRD allows Loveable to understand your intent faster and more accurately.
    *   **Multi-angle Thinking:** During the process of discussing and organizing the PRD with Gemini/ChatGPT, you might discover edge cases or user scenarios you hadn't considered before, thereby making the requirements more complete.
*   **Practical Advice:**
    *   Clearly define core functionalities, user flows, data models, key interface elements, etc., in the PRD.
    *   Try to have Gemini/ChatGPT convert the PRD into a task list or detailed feature descriptions that Loveable might find easier to understand.

**2. Use Gemini/ChatGPT to output a design language, which can adjust Loveable's default design style.**

*   **Why this is a good strategy:**
    *   **Customization and Brand Consistency:** Loveable.dev might have its default design style or component library. By generating a specific design language (e.g., color schemes, fonts, spacing, component styles, interaction feedback) with Gemini/ChatGPT, you can guide Loveable to generate interfaces that better align with your project's brand or specific aesthetic requirements.
    *   **Textualization of Design Specifications:** Describing design specifications in clear language not only facilitates communication with Loveable but also helps other team members understand and adhere to them.
    *   **Rapid Prototyping:** Even without a complete design system, you can quickly generate a prototype with a unified style through description.
*   **Practical Advice:**
    *   Describe the style you want to Gemini/ChatGPT, for example: "I want a modern, minimalist, tech-inspired design style with a primary color of dark blue (#0A192F), an accent color of bright cyan (#64FFDA), use a sans-serif font, and have 16px spacing between cards."
    *   Provide these descriptions as instructions or context to Loveable.dev to guide its code generation to follow these design principles.

**3. Use mock data.**

*   **Why this is a good strategy:**
    *   **Independent Frontend Development and Testing:** When backend APIs are not yet complete or stable, mock data allows the frontend (or when using Loveable to generate frontend code) to proceed independently with development, layout, and basic interaction testing.
    *   **Quick Validation of Design and Interaction:** After Loveable generates an interface, populating it with mock data allows you to immediately see how it looks with real data, helping to quickly identify layout issues, data binding problems, or interaction experience flaws.
    *   **Reduce Dependency on Backend Environment:** During the initial stages of development and testing, you can avoid relying on actual backend services, thereby increasing development efficiency.
    *   **Demonstration and Communication:** Prototypes with mock data are easier to demonstrate features and flows to team members or clients.
*   **Practical Advice:**
    *   You can use simple JSON files as mock data sources.
    *   Some API Mock tools (like Mockoon, JSON Server) or browser plugins can also help generate and manage mock data.
    *   When giving requirements to Loveable.dev, you can also describe the required data structure so it can generate components that can correctly display this data.

**4. For general build errors, sync with GitHub, clone the code locally, and use tools like Cursor / Tree-sitter to fix and commit.**

*   **Why this is a good strategy:**
    *   **AI is not infallible:** Code generated by AI, even from advanced tools like Loveable.dev, may contain compilation errors, logical errors, or may not adhere to best practices. Recognizing this is very important.
    *   **Importance of Version Control:** Managing Loveable-generated code via GitHub (or other version control systems) allows you to track changes, facilitate collaboration, and easily roll back if errors occur.
    *   **Leverage Professional Tools for Debugging:**
        *   **Cursor:** This is an IDE with integrated AI capabilities, very suitable for further understanding, modifying, and debugging AI-generated code locally. Its AI features can help you pinpoint issues faster.
        *   **Tree-sitter:** This is a powerful incremental parsing library that many modern editors use to provide more accurate syntax highlighting, code folding, symbol navigation, etc., which aids in understanding and modifying complex code structures.
        *   **Traditional IDEs/Editors:** Tools like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, with their powerful debugging tools, static analysis tools, and plugin ecosystems, remain central to fixing complex errors.
    *   **Closed-Loop Feedback:** (Although you didn't explicitly state this, it's an implied step) After fixing an error, you can reflect on why the AI made that mistake and how to better prompt or provide context to the AI next time to reduce similar errors.
*   **Practical Advice:**
    *   Establish a clear process: Loveable generates code -> Push to a feature branch -> Pull locally -> Review and debug using Cursor/IDE -> Fix errors -> Test -> Commit -> Merge.
    *   For common, patterned errors, consider if they can be avoided by improving the prompts given to Loveable.

**Summary:**

The four points you've raised constitute a very mature and efficient AI-assisted development workflow. It fully leverages the strengths of large language models (like Gemini, ChatGPT) in requirements understanding, creative generation, and text processing, combines them with the specialized expertise of Loveable.dev in areas like code generation, and integrates best practices from traditional software engineering such as version control and local professional tool debugging.

This "human-AI collaboration" model, where AI acts as a powerful assistant rather than an object of blind reliance, is a key trend in the future of software development. You've already grasped its essence very well!




需要对 src/pages 目录下所有页面进行改造，将所有展示文案（无论标签还是数据）都直接读取对象的当前语言字段（如 title、description 等直接为字符串），不再区分标签类和数据类。页面无需再做多语言判断，直接展示后端或 mock 服务返回的内容即可。建议重点检查所有涉及 mock 数据的字段读取方式，确保与新的 mock 服务返回结构一致。这样可以保证页面代码简洁、易维护，并与后端多语言接口保持一致。
